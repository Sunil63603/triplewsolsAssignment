Explanation :
FRONTEND
There are two pages.(One for claiming Points and another one for
LeaderBoard). Header and Footer are inside Layout file. Frontend is
built using ReactJS, tailwindCSS and shadcn in Vite bundler. 

1. In UsersPage, Theres a function which calls backend API( GET
/api/users ) to fetch list of 10 users. Newly added user is appended to
users list. Theres a function which calls backend(POST
/api/claimPoints) when user clicks on claimButton. And “claimHistory”
collection is used to track claims

2. In LeaderBoard, same backend API endpoint is used for fetching
descending order sorted list(ie, GET /api/users will return descending
order). Images used in this page are stored in public/images directory.

BACKEND
As per Instructions, i built backend using plain NodeJS(No expressJS).

1. Two route files. One for users(GET for fetching users for UserPage and
LeaderBoardPage And POST for adding new user). And another one for
claimPoints.(Points will be added to users by findOneAndUpdate() and
then new document will be inserted into claimHistory collection).

DataBase:
As per instructions, DB contains two collections. One for users and another
one for claimHistory.

1. User document : _id, name, totalPoints, claimedPoints
2. ClaimHistory: _id(document id generated by MongoDB), userId(claim
points receiver id), name, pointsClaimed, totalPoints, timeStamp.
